# JPEG-Double-Compression-Of-Image

In this program, i have used MATLAB to read an input image(jpg format), appply compression to it, apply the compression a second time and then finally display and compare the results.
This program is able to achieve very high levels of compresions, reducing the size of a jpg image drastically.
